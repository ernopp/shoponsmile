## Gotchas / personal learnings

* 2020-07-18: Make sure to turn OFF the Quality filter on the Twitter Notifications Settings page to get all mentions
* 2020-07-12: Think more carefully about the kinds of response codes you can have from the API. Hadn't considered the case when the bot tries to retrieve a protected tweet.
* 2020-07-03: Don't use Poetry for module management. It's horribly broken to install on Windows.  
* 2020-07-04: Stop using repl.it, it's cute but use VS code instead. Faster, easier.
* 2020-07-04: Don't hardcode the last_mention_id and spent an hour figuring out why you're re-processing the same mentions, ya idiot
* 2020-07-04: Make sure you haven't left the script running locally in another window... which leaves you wondering for ages why there are multiple replies
